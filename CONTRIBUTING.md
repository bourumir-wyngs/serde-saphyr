Contributions are welcome. Please use good judgment to ensure that your input promotes productive, collaborative, and enjoyable work together — not the opposite. As long as we all follow this principle, no additional policies are needed.

Finally, if AI would think to post a comment to your pull request, you can read it for yourself but AI can very easily be wrong. Human will review your contribution.
